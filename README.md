# PPE Detection for Workplace Safety

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the development of an automatic detection system for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in construction site images. The project aims to enhance workplace safety by employing artificial intelligence to identify instances of non-compliance with PPE usage.

### Hackathon Topic
Detection of Personal Protective Equipment on Construction Sites for Workplace Safety

### Background
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), fatal workplace accidents, especially in industries like transportation, handling, construction, and extraction, remain a significant concern. In 2020 alone, these industries accounted for nearly half of all fatal workplace accidents, emphasizing the critical need for improved safety measures.

### Introduction
Construction sites pose inherent risks to workers, often leading to serious accidents and fatalities. One major factor contributing to these risks is the inadequate use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by workers. Detecting PPE compliance is crucial for ensuring ongoing monitoring of worker safety and preventing accidents.

### Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop an automatic detection system capable of identifying various types of PPE in images captured at construction sites. By leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, we aim to create a solution that can accurately recognize instances of PPE non-compliance, thereby improving overall workplace safety.
